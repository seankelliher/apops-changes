## APOPS Changes

Files to modify the existing apops.mas.org website. 

## Project Status

Project is done for now, although future changes are likely. To be clear: this is not my original work. I was hired to make changes to existing work.

## Project Screen Shots

* Screenshots are not included because site is available at [apops.mas.org](https://apops.mas.org).

## Installation and Setup Instructions

This is a Wordpress site. You'll need a remote or local server capable of running the Wordpress platform.

## Reflection

This site was created in the early 2000's by developers who are now doing other things. My tasks was to modify the homepage, some of the site's sidebars, and add a "comments" archive page. There were several challenges. Some of the code was now depreciated, and much had passed though many hands who each made their own fixes. As a result, organization was not great.
